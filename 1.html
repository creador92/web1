<h2>How <a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/how-blockchain-will-transform-food-supply-chain/" target="_blank" title="Blockchain specification">Blockchain(블록체인)</a> will Transform the Food Supply Chain</h2>
<p>Blockchain's capability of tracking ownership records and tamper-resistance can be used to solve urgent issues such as food fraud, safety recalls, supply chain inefficiency and food traceability in the current food system. In this article, we are going to take a closer look to address these concerns and how blockchain could make a positive impact on the food ecosystem.</p>
<p><h2>Blockchain Applications</h2></p>
<p><h3>Food traceability</h3></p>
<img <source src="iPhone.jpg" width="100%"">>
<p>Food traceability has been at the center of recent food safety discussions, particularly with new advancements in blockchain applications. Due to the nature of perishable food, the food industry at whole is extremely vulnerable to making mistakes that would ultimately affect human lives. When foodborne diseases threaten public health, the first step to root-cause analysis is to track down the source of contamination and there is no tolerance for uncertainty. </p>
<p>Consequently, traceability is critical for the food supply chain. The current communication framework within the food ecosystem makes traceability a time-consuming task since some involved parties are still tracking information on paper. The structure of blockchain ensures that each player along the food value chain would generate and securely share data points to create an accountable and traceable system. Vast data points with labels that clarify ownership can be recorded promptly without any alteration. As a result, the record of a food item’s journey, from farm to table, is available to monitor in real-time.</p>
